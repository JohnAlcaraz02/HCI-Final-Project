## 🫥 Project Introduction

GoalGetter is a high-fidelity HCI prototype created for academic purposes to showcase the application of UI/UX principles, layout techniques, and user-centered design.
The project simulates a simple system where users can:
- Log in to the system
- Navigate to a dashboard
- View structured interface components
  
While the system is static (HTML/CSS only), it demonstrates how proper interaction flow, visual hierarchy, and usability guidelines can greatly enhance a user’s experience.

This project reflects modern HCI design values:
- Accessibility
- Simplicity
- Learnability
- Consistency
